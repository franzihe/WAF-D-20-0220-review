These uncertainties affect water balance calculations, snowpack monitoring and calibration of remote sensing algorithms and land surface models. More accurate data would improve the ability to predict future changes in water resources and mountain hazards in snow-dominated regions. In 2010, a comprehensive test site for precipitation measurements was established on a mountain plateau in southern Norway. Automatic precipitation gauge data are compared with data from a precipitation gauge in a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) wind shield construction which serves as the reference. A large number of other sensors are provided supporting data for relevant meteorological parameters. In this paper, data from three winters are used to study and determine the wind-induced under-catch of solid precipitation. Qualitative analyses and Bayesian statistics are used to evaluate and objectively choose the model that best describes the data. A continuous adjustment function and its uncertainty are derived for measurements of all types of winter precipitation (from rain to dry snow). A regression analysis does not reveal any significant misspecifications for the adjustment function, but shows that the chosen model does not describe the regression noise optimally. The adjustment function is operationally usable because it is based only on data available at standard automatic weather stations. The results show a non-linear relationship between under-catch and wind speed during winter precipitation events and there is a clear temperature dependency, mainly reflecting the precipitation type. The results allow, for the first time, derivation of an adjustment function based on measurements above 7 m s−1. This extended validity of the adjustment function shows a stabilization of the wind-induced precipitation loss for higher wind speeds.},

	abstract = {The ability of in situ snowflake microphysical observations to constrain estimates of surface snowfall accumulations derived from coincident, ground-based radar observations is explored. As part of the High-Latitude Measurement of Snowfall (HiLaMS) field campaign, a Micro Rain Radar (MRR), Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP), and Multi-Angle Snow Camera (MASC) were deployed to the Haukeliseter Test Site run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute during winter 2016/17. This measurement site lies near an elevation of 1000 m in the mountains of southern Norway and houses a double-fence automated reference (DFAR) snow gauge and a comprehensive set of meteorological observations. MASC and PIP observations provided estimates of particle size distribution (PSD), fall speed, and habit. These properties were used as input for a snowfall retrieval algorithm using coincident MRR reflectivity measurements. Retrieved surface snowfall accumulations were evaluated against DFAR observations to quantify retrieval performance as a function of meteorological conditions for the Haukeliseter site. These analyses found differences of less than 10\% between DFAR- and MRR-retrieved estimates over the field season when using either PIP or MASC observations for low wind “upslope” events. Larger biases of at least 50\% were found for high wind “pulsed” events likely because of sampling limitations in the in situ observations used to constrain the retrieval. However, assumptions of MRR Doppler velocity for mean particle fall speed and a temperature-based PSD parameterization reduced this difference to +16\% for the pulsed events.

  abstract = {The ability of in situ snowflake microphysical observations to constrain estimates of surface snowfall accumulations derived from coincident, ground-based radar observations is explored. As part of the High-Latitude Measurement of Snowfall (HiLaMS) field campaign, a Micro Rain Radar (MRR), Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP), and Multi-Angle Snow Camera (MASC) were deployed to the Haukeliseter Test Site run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute during winter 2016/17. This measurement site lies near an elevation of 1000 m in the mountains of southern Norway and houses a double-fence automated reference (DFAR) snow gauge and a comprehensive set of meteorological observations. MASC and PIP observations provided estimates of particle size distribution (PSD), fall speed, and habit. These properties were used as input for a snowfall retrieval algorithm using coincident MRR reflectivity measurements. Retrieved surface snowfall accumulations were evaluated against DFAR observations to quantify retrieval performance as a function of meteorological conditions for the Haukeliseter site. These analyses found differences of less than 10\% between DFAR- and MRR-retrieved estimates over the field season when using either PIP or MASC observations for low wind “upslope” events. Larger biases of at least 50\% were found for high wind “pulsed” events likely because of sampling limitations in the in situ observations used to constrain the retrieval. However, assumptions of MRR Doppler velocity for mean particle fall speed and a temperature-based PSD parameterization reduced this difference to +16\% for the pulsed events. Although promising, these results ultimately depend upon selection of a snowflake particle model that is well matched to scene environmental conditions.},

The estimated ice loads based on the cloud water from the simulations are generally increased. We also focus on two different icing events during January 9–18 and February 1–14. During the first event, both the run in its original configuration and the run with ICE-T overestimated the ice loads, while the second event was underestimated. For Ålvikfjellet ICE-T gives the best estimates, while for Hardingnuten the ice loads are overestimated when the wind direction is from the southeast. This is due to local terrain shielding not captured by the model. During the Feb 1–14 event, the wind direction was generally easterly, which makes comparison between the simulations and the observations more reliable. In this case, ICE-T gives a better ice load estimate. Although there are major uncertainties, especially concerning the number concentration of cloud droplets, and local terrain effects, ICE-T appears to give a better estimate of the ice loads.},

            The aim of this article is to describe the reference configuration of the convection-permitting numerical weather prediction (NWP) model HARMONIE-AROME, which is used for operational short-range weather forecasts in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. It is developed, maintained, and validated as part of the shared ALADIN–HIRLAM system by a collaboration of 26 countries in Europe and northern Africa on short-range mesoscale NWP. HARMONIE–AROME is based on the model AROME developed within the ALADIN consortium. Along with the joint modeling framework, AROME was implemented and utilized in both northern and southern European conditions by the above listed countries, and this activity has led to extensive updates to the model’s physical parameterizations. In this paper the authors present the differences in model dynamics and physical parameterizations compared with AROME, as well as important configuration choices of the reference, such as lateral boundary conditions, model levels, horizontal resolution, model time step, as well as topography, physiography, and aerosol databases used. Separate documentation will be provided for the atmospheric and surface data-assimilation algorithms and observation types used, as well as a separate description of the ensemble prediction system based on HARMONIE–AROME, which is called HarmonEPS.},

            The aim of this article is to describe the reference configuration of the convection-permitting numerical weather prediction (NWP) model HARMONIE-AROME, which is used for operational short-range weather forecasts in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. It is developed, maintained, and validated as part of the shared ALADIN–HIRLAM system by a collaboration of 26 countries in Europe and northern Africa on short-range mesoscale NWP. HARMONIE–AROME is based on the model AROME developed within the ALADIN consortium. Along with the joint modeling framework, AROME was implemented and utilized in both northern and southern European conditions by the above listed countries, and this activity has led to extensive updates to the model’s physical parameterizations. In this paper the authors present the differences in model dynamics and physical parameterizations compared with AROME, as well as important configuration choices of the reference, such as lateral boundary conditions, model levels, horizontal resolution, model time step, as well as topography, physiography, and aerosol databases used. Separate documentation will be provided for the atmospheric and surface data-assimilation algorithms and observation types used, as well as a separate description of the ensemble prediction system based on HARMONIE–AROME, which is called HarmonEPS.},

	abstract = {A realistic representation of mixed-phase clouds in weather and climate models is essential to accurately simulate the model’s radiative balance and water cycle. In addition, it is important for providing downstream applications with physically realistic model data for computation of, for instance, atmospheric icing on societal infrastructure and aircraft. An important quantity for forecasts of atmospheric icing is to model accurately supercooled liquid water (SLW). In this study, we implement elements from the Thompson cloud microphysics scheme into the numerical weather prediction model HARMONIE-AROME, with the aim to improve its ability to predict SLW. We conduct an idealised process-level evaluation of microphysical processes, and analyse the water phase budget of clouds and precipitation to compare the modified and original schemes, and also identify the processes with the most impact to form SLW. Two idealised cases representing orographic lift and freezing drizzle, both known to generate significant amounts of SLW, are setup in a 1 D column version of HARMONIE-AROME. The experiments show that the amount of SLW is largely sensitive to the ice initiation processes, snow and graupel collection of cloud water, and the rain size distribution. There is a doubling of the cloud water maximum mixing ratio, in addition to a prolonged existence of SLW, with the modified scheme compared with the original scheme. The spatial and temporal extent of cloud ice and snow are reduced, due to stricter conditions for ice nucleation. The findings are important as the HARMONIE-AROME models is used for operational forecasting in many countries in northern Europe having a colder climate, as well as for climate assessments over the Arctic region.},

	abstract = {In-cloud icing can cause damage to infrastructure and is challenging to forecast due to lack of a good representation of supercooled liquid water (SLW) in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. We validate the new microphysics scheme, ICE-T, implemented into the NWP model HARMONIE-AROME, in full 3D simulations running over a 3 month period from December 1st 2016 to February 28th 2017. Output from the model simulations are first compared with conventional observations to evaluate the overall quality, and then used as input to an ice accretion model (IAM) and compared against measured ice loads at the two test sites Hardingnuten and Ålvikfjellet. The results show a clear shift towards more cloud water and snow, and less graupel and cloud ice. This shift leads to less precipitation along the coast and more inland. The estimated ice loads based on the cloud water from the simulations are generally increased. We also focus on two different icing events during January 9–18 and February 1–14. During the first event, both the run in its original configuration and the run with ICE-T overestimated the ice loads, while the second event was underestimated. For Ålvikfjellet ICE-T gives the best estimates, while for Hardingnuten the ice loads are overestimated when the wind direction is from the southeast. This is due to local terrain shielding not captured by the model. During the Feb 1–14 event, the wind direction was generally easterly, which makes comparison between the simulations and the observations more reliable. In this case, ICE-T gives a better ice load estimate. Although there are major uncertainties, especially concerning the number concentration of cloud droplets, and local terrain effects, ICE-T appears to give a better estimate of the ice loads.},

  abstract = {A realistic representation of mixed-phase clouds in weather and climate models is essential to accurately simulate the model’s radiative balance and water cycle. In addition, it is important for providing downstream applications with physically realistic model data for computation of, for instance, atmospheric icing on societal infrastructure and aircraft. An important quantity for forecasts of atmospheric icing is to model accurately supercooled liquid water (SLW). In this study, we implement elements from the Thompson cloud microphysics scheme into the numerical weather prediction model HARMONIE-AROME, with the aim to improve its ability to predict SLW. We conduct an idealised process-level evaluation of microphysical processes, and analyse the water phase budget of clouds and precipitation to compare the modified and original schemes, and also identify the processes with the most impact to form SLW. Two idealised cases representing orographic lift and freezing drizzle, both known to generate significant amounts of SLW, are setup in a 1 D column version of HARMONIE-AROME. The experiments show that the amount of SLW is largely sensitive to the ice initiation processes, snow and graupel collection of cloud water, and the rain size distribution. There is a doubling of the cloud water maximum mixing ratio, in addition to a prolonged existence of SLW, with the modified scheme compared with the original scheme. The spatial and temporal extent of cloud ice and snow are reduced, due to stricter conditions for ice nucleation. The findings are important as the HARMONIE-AROME models is used for operational forecasting in many countries in northern Europe having a colder climate, as well as for climate assessments over the Arctic region.},

	abstract = {A new bulk microphysical parameterization (BMP) has been developed for use with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model or other mesoscale models. As compared with earlier single-moment BMPs, the new scheme incorporates a large number of improvements to both physical processes and computer coding, and it employs many techniques found in far more sophisticated spectral/bin schemes using lookup tables. Unlike any other BMP, the assumed snow size distribution depends on both ice water content and temperature and is represented as a sum of exponential and gamma distributions. Furthermore, snow assumes a nonspherical shape with a bulk density that varies inversely with diameter as found in observations and in contrast to nearly all other BMPs that assume spherical snow with constant density. The new scheme’s snow category was readily modified to match previous research in sensitivity experiments designed to test the sphericity and distribution shape characteristics. From analysis of four idealized sensitivity experiments, it was determined that the sphericity and constant density assumptions play a major role in producing supercooled liquid water whereas the assumed distribution shape plays a lesser, but nonnegligible, role. Further testing using numerous case studies and comparing model results with in situ and other observations confirmed the results of the idealized experiments and are briefly mentioned herein, but more detailed, microphysical comparisons with observations are found in a companion paper in this series (Part III, forthcoming).},

Sensitivities of the microphysics to primary ice initiation, autoconversion, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, treatment of graupel, and parameters controlling the snow and rain size distributions are tested. The sensitivity tests are performed by simulating various cloud depths (with different cloud-top temperatures) using flow over an idealized two-dimensional mountain. The height and width of the two-dimensional barrier are designed to reproduce an updraft pattern with extent and magnitude consistent with documented freezing-drizzle cases. By increasing the moisture profile to saturation at low temperatures, a deep, precipitating snow cloud is also simulated. Upon testing the primary sensitivities of the microphysics scheme in two dimensions as reported in the present study, the MM5 with the modified scheme will be tested in multiple case studies and the results will be compared to observations in a forthcoming companion paper, Part II. The key results of this study are 1) the choice of ice initiation schemes is relatively unimportant for deep precipitating snow clouds but more important for shallow warm clouds having cloud-top temperature greater than −13°C, 2) the assumed snow size distribution and associated snow diffusional growth along with the assumed graupel size distribution and method of transforming rimed snow into graupel have major impacts on the mass of cloud water and formation of freezing drizzle, and 3) a proper simulation of drizzle using a single-moment scheme and exponential size distribution requires an increase in the rain intercept parameter, thereby reducing rain terminal velocities to values more characteristic of drizzle.},

In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest.

	abstract = {More than half of the accessible freshwater is used directly or indirectly by humankind, and much of this precious resource has its origin in mountainous regions, ultimately in the form of orographic precipitation. In many areas, mountains function as “water towers” for the surrounding regions. Melt from snow cover and glaciers represents an important contribution to runoff in the surrounding areas, especially during seasons when precipitation is sparse or completely absent. Mountain freshwater resources are heavily utilized for agricultural purposes (e.g. irrigation) and for the generation of hydropower, thus being of great socio-economic importance. Yet, heavy orographic precipitation events also represent a potential hazard, as they may lead to floods, avalanches and mudslides that often cause countless loss of life and tremendous damage. The potential consequences of such events may be extreme. For instance, a single catastrophic mudslide event that took place in Venezuela on December 15, 1999, is estimated to have caused more than 20,000 casualties according to re-insurance estimates.},

Precipitation measurements have a well-documented and mostly wind-dependent bias which is especially apparent during solid precipitation events.

In this algorithm, observational data from both airborne and surface-based radars are used to construct an a priori database of snowfall profiles. These profiles are then used as input to a forward radiative transfer model to obtain brightness temperatures at high microwave frequencies. In the radiative transfer calculations, two size distributions for snowflakes and ten observed atmospheric sounding profiles are used with snowfall profiles from observations. In addition, the scattering properties of the snowflakes are calculated on the basis of realistic nonspherical shapes using discrete dipole approximation. The algorithm is first verified by airborne microwave and radar observations and then applied to the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) satellite data. The retrieved snowfall rates using AMSU-B data from three snowfall cases in the vicinity of Japan show reasonable agreement with surface radar observations with correlation coefficients of about 0.8, 0.6, and 0.96 for the three cases, respectively. The comparison results also suggest the algorithm performs better for dry and heavy snow cases, but is less accurate for wet and weak snow cases.},

	abstract = {Falling snow is an important component of global precipitation in extratropical regions. This paper describes the methodology and results of physically based retrievals of snow falling over land surfaces. Because microwave brightness temperatures emitted by snow-covered surfaces are highly variable, precipitating snow above such surfaces is difficult to observe using window channels that occur at low frequencies (ν{\textless}100 GHz). Furthermore, at frequencies ν≤37 GHz, sensitivity to liquid hydrometeors is dominant. These problems are mitigated at high frequencies (ν{\textgreater}100 GHz) where water vapor screens the surface emission, and sensitivity to frozen hydrometeors is significant. However, the scattering effect of snowfall in the atmosphere at those higher frequencies is also impacted by water vapor in the upper atmosphere. The theory of scattering by randomly oriented dry snow particles at high microwave frequencies appears to be better described by regarding snow as a concatenation of "equivalent" ice spheres rather than as a sphere with the effective dielectric constant of an air-ice mixture. An equivalent sphere snow scattering model was validated against high-frequency attenuation measurements. Satellite-based high-frequency observations from an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) instrument during the March 5-6, 2001 New England blizzard were used to retrieve snowfall over land. Vertical distributions of snow, temperature, and relative humidity profiles were derived from the Mesoscale Model (MM5) cloud model. Those data were applied and modified in a radiative transfer model that derived brightness temperatures consistent with the AMSU-B observations. The retrieved snowfall distribution was validated with radar reflectivity measurements obtained from a ground-based radar network.},

These profiles are then used as input to a forward radiative transfer model to obtain brightness temperatures at high microwave frequencies. In the radiative transfer calculations, two size distributions for snowflakes and ten observed atmospheric sounding profiles are used with snowfall profiles from observations. In addition, the scattering properties of the snowflakes are calculated on the basis of realistic nonspherical shapes using discrete dipole approximation. The algorithm is first verified by airborne microwave and radar observations and then applied to the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) satellite data. The retrieved snowfall rates using AMSU-B data from three snowfall cases in the vicinity of Japan show reasonable agreement with surface radar observations with correlation coefficients of about 0.8, 0.6, and 0.96 for the three cases, respectively. The comparison results also suggest the algorithm performs better for dry and heavy snow cases, but is less accurate for wet and weak snow cases.},

  abstract = {Falling snow is an important component of global precipitation in extratropical regions. This paper describes the methodology and results of physically based retrievals of snow falling over land surfaces. Because microwave brightness temperatures emitted by snow-covered surfaces are highly variable, precipitating snow above such surfaces is difficult to observe using window channels that occur at low frequencies (ν{\textless}100 GHz). Furthermore, at frequencies ν≤37 GHz, sensitivity to liquid hydrometeors is dominant. These problems are mitigated at high frequencies (ν{\textgreater}100 GHz) where water vapor screens the surface emission, and sensitivity to frozen hydrometeors is significant. However, the scattering effect of snowfall in the atmosphere at those higher frequencies is also impacted by water vapor in the upper atmosphere. The theory of scattering by randomly oriented dry snow particles at high microwave frequencies appears to be better described by regarding snow as a concatenation of "equivalent" ice spheres rather than as a sphere with the effective dielectric constant of an air-ice mixture. An equivalent sphere snow scattering model was validated against high-frequency attenuation measurements. Satellite-based high-frequency observations from an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) instrument during the March 5-6, 2001 New England blizzard were used to retrieve snowfall over land. Vertical distributions of snow, temperature, and relative humidity profiles were derived from the Mesoscale Model (MM5) cloud model. Those data were applied and modified in a radiative transfer model that derived brightness temperatures consistent with the AMSU-B observations. The retrieved snowfall distribution was validated with radar reflectivity measurements obtained from a ground-based radar network.},

              ). Spatial and temporal evolution of precipitation generated by cloud seeding is then quantified using radar observations and snow gauge measurements. This study uses the approach of combining radar technology and precipitation gauge measurements to quantify the spatial and temporal evolution of snowfall generated from glaciogenic cloud seeding of winter mountain cloud systems and its spatial and temporal evolution. The results represent a critical step toward quantifying cloud seeding impact. For the cases presented, precipitation gauges measured increases between 0.05 and 0.3 mm as precipitation generated by cloud seeding passed over the instruments.

The liquid water is divided into two categories, nonprecipitable cloud water and drizzle, similar to traditional Kessler-type parameterizations. The cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) count, cloud/drizzle water mixing ratios, cloud/drizzle drop concentrations, and the cloud drop integral radius are predicted in the new scheme. The source/sink terms such as autoconversion/accretion of cloud water into/by drizzle are regressed using the cloud drop size spectra predicted by an explicit microphysical model. The results from the explicit and the new bulk microphysics schemes are compared for two cases: nondrizzling and heavily drizzling stratocumulus-topped boundary layers (STBLs). The evolution of the STBL (characterized by such parameters as turbulence intensity, drizzle rates, CCN depletion rates, fractional cloud cover, and drizzle effects on internal stratification) simulated by the bulk microphysical model was in good agreement with the explicit microphysical model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

  url      = {http://hdl.handle.net/10217/48170},
  abstract = {The need for measuring snowfall is driven by the roles snow plays providing freshwater resources and affecting climate. Snow accumulations are an important resource for ecological and human needs and in many areas appear vulnerable to climate change. Snow cover modifies surface heat fluxes over areas extensive enough to influence climate at regional and perhaps global scales. Seasonal runoff from snowmelt, along with over-ocean snowfall, contributes to freshening in the Arctic and high-latitude North Atlantic oceans. Yet much of the Earth's area for which snowfall plays such significant roles is not well-monitored by observations. Radar reflectivity at 94 GHz is sensitive to scattering by snow particles and CloudSat, in a near-polar orbit, provides vertically resolved measurements of 94 GHz reflectivity at latitudes from 82 N to 82 S. While not global in areal coverage, CloudSat does provide observations sampled from regions where snowfall is the dominant form of precipitation and an important component of hydrologic processes. The work presented in this study seeks to exploit these observations by developing and assessing a physically-base snowfall retrieval which uses an explicit representation of snow microphysical properties. As the reflectivity-based snowfall retrieval problem is significantly underconstrained, a priori information about snow microphysical properties is required. The approaches typically used to develop relations between reflectivity and snowfall rate, so-called Ze-S relations, require assumptions about particle properties such as mass, area, fallspeed, and shape. Limited information about the distributions of these properties makes difficult the characterization of how uncertainties in the properties influence uncertainties in the Ze-S relations. To address this, the study proceeded in two parts. In the first, probability distributions for snow particle microphysical properties were assessed using optimal estimation applied to multi-sensor surface-based snow observations from a field campaign. Mass properties were moderately well determined by the observations, the area properties less so. The retrieval revealed nontrivial correlations between mass and area parameters not apparent in prior studies. Synthetic testing showed that the performance of the retrieval was hampered by uncertainties in the fallspeed forward model. The mass and area properties obtained from this retrieval were used to construct particle models including 94 GHz scattering properties for dry snow. These properties were insufficient to constrain scattering properties to match observed 94 GHz reflectivities. Vertical aspect ratio supplied a sufficient additional constraint. In the second part, the CloudSat retrieval, designed to estimate vertical profiles of snow size distribution parameters from reflectivity profiles, was applied to measurements from the field campaign and from an orbit of CloudSat observations. Uncertainties in the mass and area microphysical properties, obtained from the first part of this study, were substantial contributors to the uncertainties in the retrieved snowfall rates. Snowfall rate fractional uncertainties were typically 140\% to 200\%. Accumulations of snowfall calculated from the retrieval results matched observed accumulations to within 13\%, however, when allowances were made for snowfall with properties likely inconsistent with the snow particle model. Information content metrics showed that the size distribution slope parameters were moderately to strongly constrained by the reflectivity observations, while the intercept parameters were determined primarily by the a priori constraints. Results from the CloudSat orbit demonstrated the ability of the CloudSat retrieval to represent a range of scene-dependent Ze-S relations.},

  abstract   = {A two-dimensional nonhydrostatic cloud model is applied to the simulation of a tropical squall line that occurred on 23 June during the COPT 81 experiment. Owing to the use of an ice parameterization scheme, the simulation reproduces many interesting features of the stratiform part observed with Doppler radars. In particular, this includes the dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical structures of the stratiform part. Different parts are clearly identified from the simulation and observations: a leading convective zone 40-km wide with large precipitation; a developed stratiform zone stretching over 150 km with moderate precipitation; between these two regions, a transition zone 20-km wide giving only light precipitation; and a forward anvil near 12 km. The mean horizontal circulation is characterized by two mean flows: the front-to-rear flow that represents upward and rearward injection of boundary-layer air and the underlying rear-to-front flow. The simulated vertical velocity, except in the convective part, is in good agreement with observations and is characterized by a mesoscale updraft in the midtroposphere just behind the transition zone and a mesoscale downdraft under the anvil. The level of zero vertical motion, separating the mesoscale updraft from the mesoscale downdraft, has a weak slope in the horizontal as observed, and stays under the 0°C isotherm everywhere. One consequence is that the bright band is embedded in the mesoscale ascent. Detailed thermodynamical and microphysical budgets of the stratiform region are performed and lead to the following conclusions for the present simulation: 1) the warming in the poststratiform part is a consequence of the history of the storm when the subsiding low levels were dry; 2) the cooling in the mesoscale downdraft is mainly due to rainwater evaporation; 3) this net cooling is a temporal process that occurs when the stratiform anvil produced enough precipitation to counter the adiabatic warming; 4) the cooling at the base of the anvil is not due to melting but is the consequence of upward transport of low θ. The apparent heat source and moisture sink of the whole system, as well as those of the convective and stratiform parts, are also presented at different times and compared with previous numerical results and observations.},

The liquid water is divided into two categories, nonprecipitable cloud water and drizzle, similar to traditional Kessler-type parameterizations. The cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) count, cloud/drizzle water mixing ratios, cloud/drizzle drop concentrations, and the cloud drop integral radius are predicted in the new scheme. The source/sink terms such as autoconversion/accretion of cloud water into/by drizzle are regressed using the cloud drop size spectra predicted by an explicit microphysical model. The results from the explicit and the new bulk microphysics schemes are compared for two cases: nondrizzling and heavily drizzling stratocumulus-topped boundary layers (STBLs). The evolution of the STBL (characterized by such parameters as turbulence intensity, drizzle rates, CCN depletion rates, fractional cloud cover, and drizzle effects on internal stratification) simulated by the bulk microphysical model was in good agreement with the explicit microphysical model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

  abstract  = {More than half of the accessible freshwater is used directly or indirectly by humankind, and much of this precious resource has its origin in mountainous regions, ultimately in the form of orographic precipitation. In many areas, mountains function as “water towers” for the surrounding regions. Melt from snow cover and glaciers represents an important contribution to runoff in the surrounding areas, especially during seasons when precipitation is sparse or completely absent. Mountain freshwater resources are heavily utilized for agricultural purposes (e.g. irrigation) and for the generation of hydropower, thus being of great socio-economic importance. Yet, heavy orographic precipitation events also represent a potential hazard, as they may lead to floods, avalanches and mudslides that often cause countless loss of life and tremendous damage. The potential consequences of such events may be extreme. For instance, a single catastrophic mudslide event that took place in Venezuela on December 15, 1999, is estimated to have caused more than 20,000 casualties according to re-insurance estimates.},

The proposed scheme involves 90 distinct microphysical processes, which predict the mixing ratios and the number concentrations of small ice crystals, snow, graupel, and frozen drops/hail, as well as the mixing ratios of liquid water on wet precipitation ice (snow, graupel, frozen drops). The number of adjustable coefficients has been significantly reduced in comparison with other bulk schemes. Additional improvements have been made to the parameterization in the following areas: 1) representing small ice crystals with nonzero terminal fall velocities and dispersive size distributions, 2) accurate and computationally efficient calculations of precipitation collection processes, 3) reformulating the collection equation to prevent unrealistically large accretion rates, 4) more realistic conversion by riming between different classes of precipitation ice, 5) preventing unrealistically large rates of raindrop freezing and freezing of liquid water on ice, 6) detailed treatment of various rime-splintering ice multiplication mechanisms, 7) a simple representation of the Hobbs-Rangno ice enhancement process, 8) aggregation of small ice crystals and snow, and 9) allowing explicit competition between cloud water condensation and ice deposition rates rather than using saturation adjustment techniques. For the purposes of conserving the higher moments of the particle distributions, preserving the spectral widths (or slopes) of the particle spectra is shown to be more important than strict conservation of particle number concentration when parameterizing changes in ice-particle number concentrations due to melting, vapor transfer processes (sublimation of dry ice, evaporation from wet ice), and conversion between different hydrometeor species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The microphysical scheme is incorporated into a nonhydrostatic cloud model in Part II of this study. The model performed well in simulating the radar and microphysical structures of a midlatitude–continental squall line and a tropical–maritime squall system with minimal tuning of the parameterization, even though the vertical profiles of radar reflectivity differed substantially between these storms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The bulk collection efficiency and Nusselt number were parameterized in terms of the Stokes parameter and Reynolds number, respectively. The density and cone angle were parameterized in terms of the relative graupel-airstream velocity, the cloud-droplet median volume radius, and the surface temperature.

The proposed scheme involves 90 distinct microphysical processes, which predict the mixing ratios and the number concentrations of small ice crystals, snow, graupel, and frozen drops/hail, as well as the mixing ratios of liquid water on wet precipitation ice (snow, graupel, frozen drops). The number of adjustable coefficients has been significantly reduced in comparison with other bulk schemes. Additional improvements have been made to the parameterization in the following areas: 1) representing small ice crystals with nonzero terminal fall velocities and dispersive size distributions, 2) accurate and computationally efficient calculations of precipitation collection processes, 3) reformulating the collection equation to prevent unrealistically large accretion rates, 4) more realistic conversion by riming between different classes of precipitation ice, 5) preventing unrealistically large rates of raindrop freezing and freezing of liquid water on ice, 6) detailed treatment of various rime-splintering ice multiplication mechanisms, 7) a simple representation of the Hobbs-Rangno ice enhancement process, 8) aggregation of small ice crystals and snow, and 9) allowing explicit competition between cloud water condensation and ice deposition rates rather than using saturation adjustment techniques. For the purposes of conserving the higher moments of the particle distributions, preserving the spectral widths (or slopes) of the particle spectra is shown to be more important than strict conservation of particle number concentration when parameterizing changes in ice-particle number concentrations due to melting, vapor transfer processes (sublimation of dry ice, evaporation from wet ice), and conversion between different hydrometeor species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The microphysical scheme is incorporated into a nonhydrostatic cloud model in Part II of this study. The model performed well in simulating the radar and microphysical structures of a midlatitude–continental squall line and a tropical–maritime squall system with minimal tuning of the parameterization, even though the vertical profiles of radar reflectivity differed substantially between these storms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Growth conditions were chosen to simulate natural conditions in which conical graupel grow and serve as embryos for hail. Final graupel diameters ranged from 1.5 to 6 mm, with Reynolds numbers between 300 and 1500. Measurements of the mass, volume, growth height, geometric shape, and surface temperature with time were used to calculate the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers (representing the convective heat and mass transfers), bulk collection efficiency, and accretion density. The bulk collection efficiency and Nusselt number were parameterized in terms of the Stokes parameter and Reynolds number, respectively. The density and cone angle were parameterized in terms of the relative graupel-airstream velocity, the cloud-droplet median volume radius, and the surface temperature. The surface temperatures were measured remotely with an infrared radiometer to within ±0.2°C and are the first ever of growing graupel.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The bulk collection efficiency was found to be 25\% lower than that for ideal smooth spheres, while the Nusselt numbers were approximately 50\% higher than those of smooth cones. The enhanced heat convection and mass deposition or sublimation is attributed to the roughness of the ice surface. The parameterizations of bulk collection efficiency, Nusselt number, density, cone angle, and geometric shape obtained represent solutions to the heat and mass transfer equations for the laboratory-grown conical graupel and can be used to improve graupel growth calculations in cloud dynamical models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional nonhydrostatic cloud model is applied to the simulation of a tropical squall line that occurred on 23 June during the COPT 81 experiment. Owing to the use of an ice parameterization scheme, the simulation reproduces many interesting features of the stratiform part observed with Doppler radars. In particular, this includes the dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical structures of the stratiform part. Different parts are clearly identified from the simulation and observations: a leading convective zone 40-km wide with large precipitation; a developed stratiform zone stretching over 150 km with moderate precipitation; between these two regions, a transition zone 20-km wide giving only light precipitation; and a forward anvil near 12 km. The mean horizontal circulation is characterized by two mean flows: the front-to-rear flow that represents upward and rearward injection of boundary-layer air and the underlying rear-to-front flow. The simulated vertical velocity, except in the convective part, is in good agreement with observations and is characterized by a mesoscale updraft in the midtroposphere just behind the transition zone and a mesoscale downdraft under the anvil. The level of zero vertical motion, separating the mesoscale updraft from the mesoscale downdraft, has a weak slope in the horizontal as observed, and stays under the 0°C isotherm everywhere. One consequence is that the bright band is embedded in the mesoscale ascent. Detailed thermodynamical and microphysical budgets of the stratiform region are performed and lead to the following conclusions for the present simulation: 1) the warming in the poststratiform part is a consequence of the history of the storm when the subsiding low levels were dry; 2) the cooling in the mesoscale downdraft is mainly due to rainwater evaporation; 3) this net cooling is a temporal process that occurs when the stratiform anvil produced enough precipitation to counter the adiabatic warming; 4) the cooling at the base of the anvil is not due to melting but is the consequence of upward transport of low θ. The apparent heat source and moisture sink of the whole system, as well as those of the convective and stratiform parts, are also presented at different times and compared with previous numerical results and observations.},

Of the tested 7 parameterizations, 2 schemes clearly outperformed the others that overpredicted the snowfall amount by as much as {\textasciitilde}30\%–60\% on the basis of snow telemetry observations. Significant differences among these schemes were apparent in domain averages, spatial distributions of hydrometeors, latent heating profiles, and cloud fields. In comparison, model results showed relatively weak dependency on the land surface, PBL, and radiation schemes, roughly in the order of decreasing level of sensitivity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Six forms of water substance (water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and hail, i.e., graupel) are simulated. The model utilizes the “bulk water” microphysical parameterization technique to represent the precipitation fields which are all assumed to follow exponential size distribution functions. Autoconversion concepts are used to parameterize the collision-coalescence and collision-aggregation processes. Accretion processes involving the various forms of liquid and solid hydrometeors are simulated in this model. The transformation of cloud ice to snow through autoconversion (aggregation) and Bergeron process and subsequent accretional growth or aggregation to form hail are simulated. Hail is also produced by various contact mechanisms and via probabilistic freezing of raindrops. Evaporation (sublimation) is considered for all precipitation particles outside the cloud. The melting of hail and snow are included in the model. Wet and dry growth of hail and shedding of rain from hail are simulated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The simulations show that the inclusion of snow has improved the realism of the results compared to a model without snow. The formation of virga from cloud anvils is now modeled. Addition of the snow field has resulted in the inclusion of more diverse and physically sound mechanisms for initiating the hail field, yielding greater potential for distinguishing dominant embryo types characteristically different from warm- and cold-based clouds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

This scheme is used to investigate the formation and evolution of trailing stratiform precipitation in an idealized two-dimensional squall line. Results are compared to those using a one-moment version of the scheme that predicts only the mixing ratios of the species, and diagnoses the number concentrations from the specified size distribution intercept parameter and predicted mixing ratio. The overall structure of the storm is similar using either the one- or two-moment schemes, although there are notable differences. The two-moment (2-M) scheme produces a widespread region of trailing stratiform precipitation within several hours of the storm formation. In contrast, there is negligible trailing stratiform precipitation using the one-moment (1-M) scheme. The primary reason for this difference are reduced rain evaporation rates in 2-M compared to 1-M in the trailing stratiform region, leading directly to greater rain mixing ratios and surface rainfall rates. Second, increased rain evaporation rates in 2-M compared to 1-M in the convective region at midlevels result in weaker convective updraft cells and increased midlevel detrainment and flux of positively buoyant air from the convective into the stratiform region. This flux is in turn associated with a stronger mesoscale updraft in the stratiform region and enhanced ice growth rates. The reduced (increased) rates of rain evaporation in the stratiform (convective) regions in 2-M are associated with differences in the predicted rain size distribution intercept parameter (which was specified as a constant in 1-M) between the two regions. This variability is consistent with surface disdrometer measurements in previous studies that show a rapid decrease of the rain intercept parameter during the transition from convective to stratiform rainfall.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
